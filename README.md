# tw-Kanban

A webapp to visualize and use Taskwarrior as a kanban. (Like trello.com)

The idea is, that you will run it local on your device. The webapp will use the 
`task export` command to get the tasks. There also will be a way do modify the
tasks by dropping them into a different column.

# Ideas for later

- run as server connected to the taskserver.
